// House standard (Matt, 2026-08-22): every app shows its version and when
// that build was made. It's the human-readable counterpart to the auto-update
// feature: after a deploy, this is how you tell whether the tab in front of
// you actually picked up the new code, without opening devtools.
//
// The timestamp is stamped at BUILD time, not page-load time — that's the
// distinction that makes it useful. A tab left open for a week shows the
// build it is still running, so a stale one is obvious at a glance.
